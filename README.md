# Netflix Data Analysis

This project is a comprehensive analysis of Netflix's content data, providing insights into the catalog's structure, popular genres, release patterns, and more. By using data visualization and exploratory analysis, this project uncovers trends in Netflix's offerings, helping users understand the platform's content distribution and how it has evolved over time.

## Project Overview

This analysis focuses on extracting meaningful insights from Netflix's dataset through the following steps:
- **Data Cleaning:** Addressing missing values and ensuring data integrity for accurate analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing key attributes like genres, release years, ratings, and age suitability.
- **Insights Generation:** Analyzing trends in popular genres, release patterns, and the distribution of content by age rating.

The project is ideal for those interested in streaming media trends, data analysis, or data visualization with real-world datasets.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis includes the following key columns:
- `Title`: Name of the show or movie
- `Genre`: Categories or genres of the content
- `Release Year`: The year when the content was released
- `Rating`: Age rating indicating suitability for different audiences
- `Duration`: Duration of the show or movie (in seasons or minutes)
- `Country`: Country of origin for the content
- `Type`: Type of content (e.g., Movie or TV Show)

**Source:** The dataset can be found at [Netflix's public dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/netflix-shows), or any other relevant source.

## Features

This project covers:
- **Data Cleaning and Preparation:** Handling missing values and ensuring uniform formats for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Analyzing:
  - **Content Distribution by Genre:** Examining the variety of genres and the most common categories.
  - **Release Trends:** Visualizing the number of releases per year to identify content growth over time.
  - **Age Ratings Distribution:** Analyzing the suitability of content for different audiences by age rating.
  - **Country of Origin Analysis:** Exploring how the distribution of content varies by country.
- **Visualizations:** Visual representations include bar charts, line plots, and other relevant charts created using Matplotlib and Seaborn for clear insights.

## Installation
